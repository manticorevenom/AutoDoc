1. Introduction

    1.1 Purpose
    The purpose of this document is to serve as the foundation for the Commandline Interface Library Inventory System.
    The document will detail the specific features, requirements, assumptions, dependencies, and all other technical aspects of the software.
    This document is for developers and project managers.

    1.2 Scope
    The Commandline Interface Library System will serve as a database for the library.
    It will keep track of books, copies, and relative info.
    The system will also allow the saving of data through a .csv file.
    The benefits of this application is that it will be easy-to-use, extensible, and reliable.
    The goal for this application is to replace the current database for the library.

    1.3 Definitions and Abbreviations

    1.5 Overview
    The rest of the document will explain the features and related requirements.
    Section 2 will give a high-level overview of the application.
    Section 3 will be where the System Features and requirements will be documented.
