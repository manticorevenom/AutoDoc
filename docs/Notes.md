# Vision:

Application should integrate with CI/CD such that it is easy for developers to use
and it will work with a variety of document templates. The application should
contribute to the documentation process. The application should also be able
to be integrated into a variety of version controls systems. We would also like it
to be able to be integrated in any part of life-cycle phase.
****
# Current:
Application is being designed as semi-automated document generator. It will
work with the SRS template from IEEE at first but if we get to develop it
further we will add to its functionality. It looks at the document and some source code
and automatically updates the document.
****
# Future Improvements:
Automatically update the code.

Pull from multiple documents and code files.

Support different document file formats.

Support different code languages.

Support version history modification.

Create unit tests for each method in each class.

Add document templates for the user.
****
# Known Bugs:
Multi-line context does not work properly.
