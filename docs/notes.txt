Vision: Application should integrate with CI/CD such that it is easy for developers to use
        and it will work with a variety of document templates. The application should
        contribute to the documentation process. The application should also be able
        to be integrated into a variety of version controls systems. We would also like it
        to be able to be integrated in any life-cycle phase.

Current: Application is being designed as semi-automated document generator. It will
         work with the SRS template from IEEE at first but if we get to develop it
         further we will add to its functionality.
